### PowerApps Landing Page Task Content QA Guide by CodeRoad

This guide provides a step-by-step process for verifying the correct delivery of Task Info content, URL and title for the Landing Page creation.







#### Power Apps Landing Page Task Structure.

A Power Apps Landing Page Task is based on two Request Details, which guide the creation of HTML content to add manually in a Landing Page using Dealer.com’s tool, Composer, and the Content To Post section, which is the result of the Creative Team’s work based on both. The two Request Details contain their own elements, the most important ones for the QA process being mentioned here:

Content Request Details:

Name of Dealership: The name of the dealership account the content will be directed to. (Ex. Daniels Long Chevrolet)

Account ID: The alphanumeric account ID the dealership has for the CMS system, and reflected if appliable in the Page Build Extension or URL for the new page (ex. danielslongchevroletco)

Topic: The main theme the HTML custom content should be about. This can be a specific model from a certain year and a chosen Make/OEM, a dealership’s profit center’s specific service, a certain car body type (SUV, Trucks, Sedans, etc.) that can be related to a specific OEM/Make or not.

Content Type: The type of page the content should be adapted to. This can be Hub Pages (Content that serves as a focal point for a particular topic or theme, with links to multiple related pages as articles, blog posts, or product listings), MSLPs (Content that details with images and text the main features of a specific car), Comparison pages (Content that compares the features between two cars, two services, and others. Usually, it is used to showcase the advantages of a certain car model related to the dealership’s OEM/Make above a similar model that can be related or not.), etc.

Additional Info: Extra details that the page’s content should include.

Geos: The geographical location (city/town, state) the content should adapt to. This helps the content advertise the advantages of the car model or dealership’s services based on the chosen location’s attractions, landscapes, etc.

Links: URLs the content should include in the shape of <a> HTML tags. They can be both relative (ex. /dealership/about.htm, /new-inventory/index.htm) or absolute (ex. ).

Page Request Details:

Page Build Title: The title the new or existing Landing Page should have.

Page Build Extension: The absolute or relative URL link the Landing Page is bound to. Can lead to an existing page, or it will be for a new page. (Ex. https://www.victorycdjrmarietta.com/ram-2500-vs-ford-f-250-shallotte-nc.htm, https://soundfordfd.cms.dealer.com/service/service-financing.htm, /research/vistiq.htm). In the case of absolute links, there are the live sites (ex. https://www.victorycdjrmarietta.com/ram-2500-vs-ford-f-250-shallotte-nc.htm ) and the Composer Dealer.com domain sites (https://soundfordfd.cms.dealer.com/service/service-financing.htm).

Content To Post: An HTML text that is the result of both Request Details and should be copied and pasted by the MS team to the new/existing Landing Page.

#### Task Content

The Task Content is an HTML-based text that is written in the “Content To Post” section that the MS Team will add to the new or existing Landing Page.

Task Content Example:

<h2>2026 Cadillac VISTIQ — Answering Common FAQs</h2>

<h3>What is the Cadillac VISTIQ?</h3>

<p>Cadillac VISTIQ SUVs are midsize three-row electric SUVs positioned between the Cadillac LYRIQ and the Cadillac Escalade IQ. New Cadillac VISTIQ SUVs take inspiration from the gas-powered 2025 Cadillac XT6 and are sometimes referred to as the "baby Cadillac Escalade".</p>

<h3>Does the Cadillac VISTIQ come with Super Cruise®?</h3>

<p>Yes, all 2026 Cadillac VISTIQ models offer Super Cruise® Hands-Free Driver Assistance Technology with a 3-year OnStar® One Super Cruise Plan.

#### Potential Task Content/Structure considerations for QA:

Sometimes, when posting the Task to the Power Apps Queue, there are some mistakes left untouched from the Creative Staff’s part, leading to confusion for the MS Team in the moment of creating the pages, and depending of the gravity of the situation, having to request a rework to the client. There are certain errors that can occur in one of three key elements of the Task’s structure, either isolated or combined:

##### Page Build Extension QA:

A correct Page Build Extension URL should ideally start with the CMS subdomain chain (https://[dealership account ID].cms.dealer.com/) and have their article permalinks only with alphanumeric characters and the words separated only by a hyphen (“-”), and should end with the “.htm” suffix



Examples of a correct Page Build Extension URL with the “blackwellfordfd” account ID:





Examples of incorrect Page Build Extension URLs:

blackwellfordfd.dealer/dealership/from-america-for-america.htm (first part of the URL should be “blackwellfordfd.cms.dealer.com”)

blackwellfordfd.cms.dealer.com/dealership/from america for|america.htm (the permalinks words are separated by spaces and other characters different of a hyphen)

https://blackwellfordfd.cms.dealer.com/deale#sh%p/from-am$rica-for-a&erica.htm (there are external characters apart of points (.), hyphens(-) and alphanumeric characters)

https://blackwellfordfd.cms.dealer.com/dealership/from-america-for-america (the link doesn’t end with the “.htm” suffix)

https://blackwellfordfd.cms.dealer.com/dealership/from-america-for-america.html (the link shouldn’t end with any other suffix than “.htm”)



The given Page Build Extension URL always should have words that relate to the “Page Title” and/or the “Content To Post” sections.

Example of a coherent Page Build Extension URL using a Topic, a Title and a section of the Content to Post for the accountID “unitycadillac”:

Topic: 2026 Cadillac Vistiq

Title: 2026 Cadillac VISTIQ For Sale At Unity Cadillac

Extract from Content To Post: <h3>LUXURY FOR YOUR LIFE</h3><p>In VISTIQ, moments of luxury are a daily expectation. In all three rows, every detail, intuitive technology and excellent view will have you daydreaming about your next long drive.</p>

URL:

This Page Build Extension URL example is correct and matches the content, since the Topic for the Task talks about the 2026 Cadillac Vista. The URL should match with the Geos (if they specify them), the Topic and the Content Type

Example of an incoherent Page Build Extension URL using a Topic, a Title and a section of the Content to Post for the accountID “unitycadillac”:

Topic: 2026 Cadillac Vistiq

Title: 2026 Cadillac VISTIQ For Sale At Unity Cadillac

Extract from Content To Post: <h3>LUXURY FOR YOUR LIFE</h3><p>In VISTIQ, moments of luxury are a daily expectation. In all three rows, every detail, intuitive technology and excellent view will have you daydreaming about your next long drive.</p>

URL: https://unitycadillac.cms.dealer.com/2025-cadillac-optiq.htm

This Page Build Extension URL example is not correct because while the Topic for the Task talks about the 2026 Cadillac Vista, the extension talks for the 2025 Cadillac Optiq. It differs from the main Topic by far.

There will also be the case where the accountID of the request and the one from the URL won’t match. If this happens, it counts as a mistake too.



##### Task Content internal QA points:

As a note, the content should be HTML-based text, with headings, lists and paragraphs made clear and displayed. Avoid sending plain text without HTML tags to the Content To Post section (check Task Content section for an example).



Each HTML element should have both opening and closing HTML tags that correspond to their purpose. There should not be missing closing/opening tags or a mismatch between both.



Correct Tag structure examples:

For listings: <[ul/ol]><li>Ford Escape</li><li>Ford Edge</li></[ul/ol]>

For paragraphs: <p>Visit our showroom to learn more and schedule a test drive near Shallotte, NC.</p>

For headings: <h2>Visit Unity Cadillac Today</h2>

For links: <a href="/new-cadillac/suvs/vistiq-akron-oh.htm">new Cadillac VISTIQ inventory</a>

This can apply for any HTML element.



Incorrect Tag structure examples:

<h2>Visit Unity Cadillac today (the </h2> closing tag is missing in this header. This also can apply to paragraphs, lists and links, from which the latter can lead to redirection errors)

<h2>Visit Unity Cadillac Today</h3> (the </h3> closing tag doesn’t match with the <h2> opening tag. This also applies the other way around)

<a href=”/new-cadillac/suvs/vistiq-akron-oh.htm”>visit our new Cadillac VISTIQ inventory</a> (the ” symbol shouldn’t be used in href attributes for the <a> tag for links, instead use the " symbol)

##### Content/Page Extension URL/Title incoherence:

As the Topic is established, all the three core elements of the Task (Content To Post, Page Extension URL, and Page Title) should not only match the Topic, but also between themselves.

Examples of incoherence between the Page Extension URL, the Content To Post, and the Page Title:

Example 1.

Topic:

Lexus RX Lease Deals & Specials in Chester Springs, PA

Content Type:

Finance/Leasing

Page extension URL:



Page Title:

Point of incoherences: While the Page Extension URL and the Content are talking about a Military Community support program by Daniels Long Chevrolet, the Page Title is written like it is for Coast Chevrolet, which is a different dealership than the one indicated. This mistake can lead to confusion for the MS team when creating a new Landing Page, or in the case it’s a link for an existing page, to post the wrong Content.

#### Levels of QA results:

When making the QA for the Task Content/Structure elements and Content to Post and their coherence between each, there could be three levels of results:

Passed: Task Content/Structure elements and Content to Post are matching each other, the Content to Post HTML is written in the correct format and with no missing or mismatching HTML opening and closing tags between elements.

Observed: There are some issues with the HTML text for the Content to Post (missing/badly written tags, some missing elements in the attributes of said tags, etc), the Page Extension URL doesn’t match the Content To Post and/or Title according to the Topic, or the Title doesn’t reflect the Topic from the Content To Post and/or Page Extension URL.

Critical: The Content to Post does not match the Page Title and/or Page Extension URL in the Topic at all. The gravity of the situation relies on being the main reason for confusion in the MS team at the time for creating new Landing Pages. It also can involve the issues in the Observed state.

The Creative staff, according to the state of the QA, can take simple actions to solve it such as changing some words of the URL or the Title, or correcting the issues in the HTML code. In the Critical case, however, must check the Task Info to make sure it matches the Topic and other elements from the Content Request Details, and re-do the HTML text from scratch if necessary.

By following this guide, you’ll ensure consistency and accurate Quality Assurance revision of Task elements, allowing the Creative Team to deliver Landing Page Tasks and content that make sense and make a more agile and efficient MS Landing Page creation workflow. Always prioritize understanding the instructions fully before proceeding.

Thanks!
